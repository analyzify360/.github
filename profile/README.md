## 🔗 Bittensor Subnet Development — Decentralized AI Infrastructure

**Analyzify360 Global** actively develops **custom Bittensor subnets** — decentralized AI networks where intelligence, compute, and value intersect.

Our **Subnet Engineering Division** specializes in the design and deployment of **production-grade subnets** that extend the Bittensor ecosystem with real-world AI applications, research-driven incentives, and enterprise scalability.

### ⚙️ Core Capabilities
- **Custom Subnet Architecture** — Consensus logic, neuron scoring, and validation mechanisms for domain-specific intelligence networks.  
- **Miner & Validator Implementation** — High-performance node development using `subtensor`, `axon`, and PyTorch-based models.  
- **Model Integration Pipelines** — Seamless connection of AI models (LLMs, NLP, CV) into decentralized learning environments.  
- **Governance & Tokenomics Design** — TAO reward distribution modeling, subnet incentive structures, and trust-weight calibration.  
- **DevOps & Deployment** — Secure, containerized multi-node setups using Docker, Helm, and Kubernetes.  
- **Monitoring & Analytics** — Telemetry dashboards, validator monitoring, and network health analytics for on-chain visibility.  

### 🧩 Technical Stack
